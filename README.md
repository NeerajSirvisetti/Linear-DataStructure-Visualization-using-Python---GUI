# Linear-DataStructure-Visualization-using-Python---GUI


  In this project, visualization of data structure operations like Push, Pop are showed up visually.
It helps to teach visually instead of using common pen and paper to explain the opearaitons of stack, queue and Linked List.
The aim of the proposed system is to overcome the problem of proper animations.
